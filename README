This repository contains all the code I've collected and adapted while exploring
the wonderful embedded world of AVR CMU's and many other components that can be
attached to it to form a complete embedded system.

Until further notice, all this code is targeted at the ATMEGA168/328.
Accompanying information can be found at http://christophe.vg/embedded

Top-level directories/projects:
  blink    your typical Hello World style, make a LED blink, first program
  serial   adding a serial connection using the MAX232
  xt0f-003 my first wireless sensor node based on the ATMEGA8 and XBee module
  xt0f-004 my second wireless sensor, similar to the xt0f-003, but now based on
           the ATMEGA1284p, with a serial connection and an XBee module

Other directories include:
  moose    all code targetting the ATMEGA and related hardware (submodule)
  tools    some tools to improve life
