This repository contains all the code I've collected and adapted while exploring
the wonderful embedded world of AVR CMU's and many other components that can be
attached to it to form a complete embedded system.

Until further notice, all this code is targeted at the ATMEGA168/328.
Accompanying information can be found at http://christophe.vg/embedded
